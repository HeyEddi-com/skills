# Audience intake — product.md schema

**Date:** 2026-07-04

`write_product` must produce these sections for greenfield products. Downstream design skills **block craft** on flagship routes if missing.

## Required sections

### Personas

| Name | Role | Primary job | Anxiety | Design implication |
|------|------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| … | … | … | … | … |

Minimum **2 personas** for B2B SaaS (buyer/evaluator + daily user).

### Per-route intent

| Route | Register | Primary persona | User mindset | Success feeling |
|-------|----------|-----------------|--------------|-----------------|
| `/` | brand | … | … | … |
| `/dashboard` | product | … | … | … |

### Competitors

- Users compare us to: …
- We win on: …
- We intentionally avoid: …

### Anti-audience

Who this product is **not** for (prevents wrong aesthetic).

### Voice & tone

One paragraph: plain/confident/technical; verb-first buttons; error voice.

## Clarify round

If user prompt lacks audience hints, ask **one round** (2–3 questions):

- Who uses this daily vs who buys/evaluates?
- What do they compare you to?
- What should it **not** feel like?

Then write product.md — do not guess personas silently.
