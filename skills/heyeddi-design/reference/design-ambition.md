# Design ambition — project-specific, top-tier craft

**Date:** 2026-07-06

**Audience** (`audience-design.md`) = *who* and *why*.  
**Modern reference** (`modern-reference.md`) = *how* (tokens, surfaces, type).  
**This file** = *how impressive* — the bar for **individual**, memorable design per project.

Default stance: **strive for impressive craft** unless the user explicitly asks for minimal/admin/wireframe fidelity. Do not wait for the user to say "make it artistic" — that is the baseline for flagship routes.

## What "impressive" means here

Not decoration for its own sake. A persona on a **flagship route** (`/`, `/login`, `/dashboard`, `/settings`) should feel within 5 seconds:

1. **This product has a point of view** — not a PrimeVue demo with the logo swapped
2. **Hierarchy is intentional** — type scale, spacing rhythm, one clear primary action
3. **At least one memorable detail** — hero rhythm, nav character, table/data treatment, or settings IA — **chosen for this product**, not copied from the last HeyEddi project
4. **Differentiation vs competitors** (from `product.md`) is **visible** in layout or copy — not only in `product.md` text

| Shipped | Not shipped |
|---------|-------------|
| Stripe/Linear-level **restraint + precision** for B2B | Random gradients and glass everywhere |
| Warm Notion-like **approachability** when persona needs it | Stock "SaaS purple gradient hero" template |
| Bold editorial **brand** when brief asks for personality | Same sidebar + profile cards on every app |
| Sketch/wireframe fidelity when brief scopes it | Polished template pretending to be custom |

## Project signature (required per product)

Before `craft` on any flagship route, define in `designs/<feature>/brief.md`:

```markdown
## Design signature (this project only)

- **Aesthetic energy:** (e.g. calm precision | warm human | bold editorial | dense utilitarian)
- **Signature moment:** one screen/region that should feel unmistakably *this* product
- **Borrow:** 2 named references — what specifically (not "like Linear")
- **Avoid:** 2 tells that would make this look like our last scaffold or a competitor clone
- **Memorable detail:** one concrete choice (type pairing, hero grid, stat treatment, settings card rhythm, nav pill style, …)
```

Re-read this section at **craft** and **polish**. If implementation could belong to another product with a name swap, **revise before calling done**.

## Discovery — ask when ambition is unclear

Add to `discover` (2–3 questions per round):

- What should a user **remember** about this UI vs `{competitor}`?
- **Aesthetic energy** — restrained precision, warm, bold, or utilitarian? Any reference that nails the feeling?
- On the flagship route: what is the **one moment** we should nail (hero, first table load, settings save, sign-in trust)?
- What must this **NOT** look like? (generic admin, template marketplace, previous project?)

If the user says "top notch / artistic / impressive" — treat that as **confirmation** of the default bar, not a license to skip `shape` or audience work.

## Shape & explore

- **`research`:** find 2–3 references **in the product's category**, not only generic "SaaS dashboard 2026"
- **`explore`:** **2–4 lanes** that differ in hierarchy, density, nav, or typographic voice — not palette-only variants
- **Brief:** Design signature section is **mandatory** for flagship routes; optional for internal tools only when brief says minimal/admin

## Craft — ambition checklist (before done)

After `modern-reference` anti-slop and before audience-fit:

- [ ] **Signature moment** from brief is implemented and visible at 1440 and 375
- [ ] **Three PrimeVue tells removed** (default card padding mush, undifferentiated table, system-font sameness, flat gray shell — pick what applied)
- [ ] **Competitor differentiation** — one layout or copy choice a clone would not make
- [ ] **Decision log** cites persona + **specific** borrowed pattern + **this project's** memorable detail
- [ ] Screenshot test: would a designer say "template" or "crafted for {product_name}"?

If any fail → `@heyeddi-design polish` or revise in craft; do not hand off to `@design-handoff` with generic chrome.

## Polish & critique

When user asks to "make it more artistic" or "top of the line":

1. Re-read **Design signature** — sharpen memorable detail, do not add random ornament
2. Upgrade **typography + surfaces + spacing** before adding new components
3. Run `audience-fit` + ambition checklist; report which dimension was weak

## Handoff boundary

- **`@product-translator` wireframes** = layout intent only (ASCII, diagrams)
- **`@heyeddi-design` shape/craft** = where ambition and visual signature live
- **`@design-handoff`** = implement approved mockups/briefs — not a substitute for skipping ambition in design phase
