# Clarify before act (all HeyEddi skills)

**Date:** 2026-07-04

Every skill follows this order when information is missing:

```
1. Read .heyeddi/     product.md, design.md, routing, skills-index, handoffs
2. Run load/audit     your skill's readonly script
3. Inspect repo       code, openapi, tests: objective facts
4. Ask the user       1 focused question or numbered list (max one round unless blocking)
5. Act                never guess routes, API fields, or layout intent
```

## When to ask

- Ambiguous product intent, missing persona, unclear register (brand vs app)
- Missing handoff (no mockup, no brief, no mobile)
- Irreversible stack choice (Flutter vs Vue, Firebase vs API-only)
- User message conflicts with `product.md`

## When not to ask

- Answer is in `.heyeddi/`: read it first
- OpenAPI / build / tests settle it
- Scaffold defaults exist (`stack.json`, foundations)

## Anti-patterns

- Guessing API field names → sync OpenAPI instead
- Dumping 10 questions at once → 2-3 per round
- Skipping `product.md` personas on design work → run `@heyeddi-intake` or `@heyeddi-design discover`
