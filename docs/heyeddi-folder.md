# The `.heyeddi/` folder

**Date:** 2026-07-14

Every HeyEddi client or internal app uses a **`.heyeddi/`** directory at the project root. It is the single place for product context, design artifacts, and documents that skills generate — so nothing important gets lost at repo root.

## What is HeyEddi?

**HeyEddi** is a **collaborative workspace for agents and humans**. The `.heyeddi/` folder in your repo is where product context, design artifacts, and skill-generated docs live so AI agents and your team share one source of truth while building SaaS apps (Vue or **Flutter** + FastAPI or Firebase, OpenProps + PrimeVue for web).

We publish **free, open [Cursor Agent Skills](https://github.com/HeyEddi-com/skills)** — install the full bundle with `npx skills add HeyEddi-com/skills -a cursor -y --skill '*'` or `./scripts/install-skills.sh --all`. Invoke with `@skill-name` in Cursor.

**Need people, not just agents?** [heyeddi.com/humans](https://heyeddi.com/humans) — hire vetted designers, engineers, and product folks to complement your agent workflows.

## Conventions

1. **`scaffold_stack`** (via `@project-engineering` for Vue or `@flutter-engineering` for Flutter) creates `.heyeddi/` if missing, including `README.md`.
2. **`@heyeddi-intake`** (greenfield) writes `product.md`, optional mockups/briefs, and `docs/intake/skill-routing.json` before other skills.
3. **`@heyeddi-product`** reviews intake, writes feature specs (stories + AC), delegates UX/design/engineering research, and synthesizes review plans under `docs/product/`.
4. **Cross-pillar sync** — `@heyeddi-orchestrator` `init_workflow_sync` + `opinions/`; product, UX, and design pillars opine on each route (see `docs/cross-pillar-workflow.md`).
5. **Design skills** write to `.heyeddi/design.md` and `.heyeddi/designs/` (product.md often from `@heyeddi-intake` first).
6. **QA / PR skills** write reports to `.heyeddi/docs/` (e.g. `ship-report.md`, `pr-42-tracking.md`).
7. **Engineering excellence** maintains `.heyeddi/docs/engineering/` and audit reports (`engineering-audit-<date>.md`).
8. **UX flow auditor** maintains `.heyeddi/docs/ux-flows/` and index `ux-flows.md`.
9. **Visual auditor** writes contrast reports and screenshots to `.heyeddi/audits/visual/` (not repo-root `.visual-audit/`).
10. **Skill orchestrator** — `.heyeddi/` stays current **automatically** when any HeyEddi skill tool runs (refreshes `skills-index.*` when missing). Optional explicit full sync: `@heyeddi-orchestrator` `sync`.
11. **Audience-driven design** — `product.md` Personas + Per-route intent drive `@heyeddi-design`; see `docs/design-excellence.md`.
12. **Legacy paths** at repo root (`PRODUCT.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `designs/`, `.visual-audit/`) still readable — skills write to `.heyeddi/` first.

## Path resolution

Shared helper: `skills/project-engineering/scripts/_heyeddi_paths.py` (copied into design skills). Scripts resolve canonical paths before falling back to legacy locations.
