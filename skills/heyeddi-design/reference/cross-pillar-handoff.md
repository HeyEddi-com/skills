# Cross-pillar workflow

**Date:** 2026-07-07

Design does not ship in isolation. Before **craft** / **critique** / **polish**:

1. `@skill-orchestrator` `load_workflow_context --route <route>`
2. Read `opinions/product.md` and `opinions/ux.md` for this route
3. After work: update `design.md` Decision log + relevant `designs/<feature>/`
4. `append_pillar_opinion --pillar design`
